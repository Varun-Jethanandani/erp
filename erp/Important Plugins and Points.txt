OOP CONCEPTS:
1.Whenever a child class has a constructor in php it is not necessary for it to use
scope resolution opertator and take values from parent class in php
2.When we create an object of child class in php it first creates an object of its parent class
if construtor of parent class has been assigned values from child class then it gets those values otherwise null values are passed
3.Destructor is called whenever object gets out of memory or if it gets killed
4.FOr child class automatically destructor of its parent class is called
5.If we use separate destructor for child class then this destructor overrides the destructor of parent class(Recall the diagram
of sir)
6.Two methods scope resolution operator
 a)CLASS NAME::(this can be used if b extends a and c extends b and we want to use constructor of a in c because b is the only parent of c)
 b)parent::
